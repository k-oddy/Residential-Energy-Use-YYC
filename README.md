# Residential-Energy-Use-YYC
Shows the data used in my project, "Residential Energy Consumption in Calgary," created for The Univeristy of Calgary and Sustainable Calgary. 

Files include: 
- 7 residential consumption datasets from 2018-2023; 6 indivdual years, and 1 comprehensive dataset.
- 1 population growth dataset, with data showing total population and population growth, from 2009-2019.
- 1 community district boundaries dataset, modified to include geospatial location data.
- 1 dataset showing the time period most dwellings were built in each Calgary neighbourhood.
- 1 consumption hot spot analysis dataset.
- 1 consumption hot spot summary analysis dataset. This one is in .xml format as I was unable to convert it to .csv.
- 1 creative commons license.
  
All data used in this project is sourced from the City of Calgary, via Open Calgary. Dataset sources include:
